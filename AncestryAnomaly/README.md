This is the location for the Ancestry Anomaly quantification tool that was used in Barrie et al. 2022 (in prep).

It extends the model of:
"Genomewide analysis of admixture and adaptation in the Africanized honeybee" RM Nelson, A Wallberg, ZLP Sim√µes, DJ Lawson, MT Webster. [Molecular Ecology 26 (14), 3603-3617](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mec.14122) by allowing it to work with summary data.

See [ukb_steppe_proc.R](ukb_steppe_proc.R) for an example. The main codebase is in [ancestryanomaly.R](ancestryanomaly.R).
